      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gauthier Chicot, Ing., PhD, is the CEO and co-founder of DiamFab. After completing his engineering studies in Electronics at Polytech’ Grenoble, he earned his PhD in Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology from the University of Grenoble in 2013. At the CEA and CNRS, his research primarily focused on ultra-wide band gap semiconductors, specifically the development of power electronics components using diamond. He particularly concentrated on optimizing the performance of these components in direct relation to epitaxial diamond layers during a post-doctoral research position at G2ELab. Leveraging this expertise, he began working in 2017 to commercialize the research outcomes from CNRS/Institut Néel, which led to the founding of the startup DIAMFAB in 2019, which he has led since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
