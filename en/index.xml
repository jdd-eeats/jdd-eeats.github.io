      <guid>https://jdd-eeats.github.io/en/english/sessions/729575/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation traces the evolution of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s scientific journey in response to environmental and climate challenges related to power electronics technology. It covers the transition from deconstructing a myth to exploring scientific directions compatible with environmental and societal issues, leading to the first steps in the field of more sustainable power electronics. Changes in the ways of defining and conducting research activities will be discussed, with these points to be further explored in a discussion with the participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gauthier Chicot, Ing., PhD, is the CEO and co-founder of DiamFab. After completing his engineering studies in Electronics at Polytech’ Grenoble, he earned his PhD in Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology from the University of Grenoble in 2013. At the CEA and CNRS, his research primarily focused on ultra-wide band gap semiconductors, specifically the development of power electronics components using diamond. He particularly concentrated on optimizing the performance of these components in direct relation to epitaxial diamond layers during a post-doctoral research position at G2ELab. Leveraging this expertise, he began working in 2017 to commercialize the research outcomes from CNRS/Institut Néel, which led to the founding of the startup DIAMFAB in 2019, which he has led since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kylian Millard holds an engineering degree in Physics Engineering, obtained in 2020 from INSA Toulouse. He went on to pursue a PhD at CEA-Leti focused on developing a complex routing system in silicon nitride integrated photonics, aimed at creating a projector for augmented reality glasses. He defended his thesis in November 2023. Since 2024, he has been working at Steerlight as a photonic design engineer, developing a third-generation LiDAR system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A chemical engineer by training (Engineering School of Chemistry in Montpellier, with a specialization in materials), she discovered microelectronics during her PhD at EEATS, carried out jointly at CEA-Leti and LTM (a CNRS laboratory). Her thesis, completed in 2017, focused on the integration of III-V semiconductor materials into MOSFET transistors. She then developed expertise in the environmental challenges of electronics at the Fraunhofer Institute (IZM) in Berlin, Germany, where she worked on fixed-term contracts for six years before returning to Grenoble. Since November 2023, she has been a researcher (on a fixed-term contract) in CEA-Leti’s eco-innovation program, specializing in packaging and 3D integration technologies. Her work particularly aims to advance circular economy approaches and the repairability of integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The research programming law assigns to the state the national policy on scientific integrity (Article L211-2 of the Research Code). In this context, public institutions, including universities and research organizations, provide the conditions for meeting the requirements of scientific integrity and establish the necessary systems to promote the values of scientific integrity. Research work, including all public research activities, must comply with the requirements of scientific integrity to ensure their honesty and scientific rigor and to strengthen the trust relationship with society. The presentation will begin by describing the main serious violations of scientific integrity that can affect research activities (such as fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, concealment of conflicts of interest, etc.) before reviewing the bad practices related to data retention and management, and finally recalling the common misconduct in publications (signing a publication without justification, disputes over author order, self-plagiarism, publishing in predatory journals, etc.). In the second part, the speakers will present the systems implemented by UGA, a signatory of the French Charter of Research Ethics (2015), to handle reports of potential violations of scientific integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
