      <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation traces the evolution of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s scientific journey in response to environmental and climate challenges related to power electronics technology. It covers the transition from deconstructing a myth to exploring scientific directions compatible with environmental and societal issues, leading to the first steps in the field of more sustainable power electronics. Changes in the ways of defining and conducting research activities will be discussed, with these points to be further explored in a discussion with the participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Research and Scientific Integrity at UGA</title>
      <link>https://jdd-eeats.github.io/en/english/sessions/729576/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The research programming law assigns to the state the national policy on scientific integrity (Article L211-2 of the Research Code). In this context, public institutions, including universities and research organizations, provide the conditions for meeting the requirements of scientific integrity and establish the necessary systems to promote the values of scientific integrity. Research work, including all public research activities, must comply with the requirements of scientific integrity to ensure their honesty and scientific rigor and to strengthen the trust relationship with society. The presentation will begin by describing the main serious violations of scientific integrity that can affect research activities (such as fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, concealment of conflicts of interest, etc.) before reviewing the bad practices related to data retention and management, and finally recalling the common misconduct in publications (signing a publication without justification, disputes over author order, self-plagiarism, publishing in predatory journals, etc.). In the second part, the speakers will present the systems implemented by UGA, a signatory of the French Charter of Research Ethics (2015), to handle reports of potential violations of scientific integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
